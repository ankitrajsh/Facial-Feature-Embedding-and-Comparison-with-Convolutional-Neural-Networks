Face Image Embedding and Matching
Overview
This project involves processing face images to generate and compare embeddings using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The goal is to normalize image brightness and contrast, extract embeddings from images using the DeepFace library, and compare embeddings to calculate the matching percentage between two images.

Project Components
1. Image Processing
Normalization: The normalize_brightness_contrast_grayscale function performs the following operations:
Brightness Normalization: Converts the image to LAB color space, equalizes the histogram of the L channel (lightness), and converts it back to BGR color space.
Contrast Normalization: Applies CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) to the L channel in the LAB color space to enhance contrast.
Grayscale Conversion: Converts the image to grayscale after normalizing brightness and contrast.
2. Embedding Extraction
DeepFace Integration: The get_all_embeddings function reads an image, processes it, and generates an embedding using the Facenet512 model from the DeepFace library. The embedding is a numerical representation of the face that captures its features.
3. CNN Model
CNNModel Class: Defines a simple 1D convolutional neural network:

Layer: A single 1D convolutional layer (nn.Conv1d) that reduces the embedding dimension from 512 to 128.
Embedding Processing: The get_CNN_embeddings function passes the embeddings through the CNN model to obtain processed embeddings. It handles tensor conversion and batch dimensions.

4. Matching Percentage Calculation
Matching Calculation: The matching_percentage function compares embeddings of two images to compute the percentage of matching elements. It performs the following:
Extracts embeddings for both images.
Processes the embeddings through the CNN model.
Calculates the percentage of matching elements between the processed embeddings of the two images.
5. Directory Handling
Image Directory Setup: The script lists all images in a specified directory and its subfolders. This setup is used to gather images for processing and embedding extraction.
Usage
Install Dependencies: Ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can use pip to install them:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python deepface torch numpy
Run the Script: The script is designed to be run in an environment where you have access to image files and directories. Modify the dir variable to point to your directory of images.

Output: The script will print the percentage of matching elements between the embeddings of two images.

Notes
Temporary File Handling: The script creates a temporary grayscale image file to use with DeepFace and deletes it after processing.
Embedding Dimensions: The CNN model reduces the embedding dimension from 512 to 128. Adjustments to the CNN model or its parameters may be necessary based on your requirements.
Example
To calculate the matching percentage between two images, you can call the matching_percentage function with the paths of the two images.

python
Copy code
percentage = matching_percentage('path/to/image1.jpg', 'path/to/image2.jpg')

Face Image Embedding and Matching
Overview
This project focuses on processing face images to generate embeddings and compare them using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The process involves normalizing image brightness and contrast, extracting embeddings using the DeepFace library, and comparing these embeddings to calculate the matching percentage between two images.

Project Components
1. Image Processing
normalize_brightness_contrast_grayscale(image)
This function processes the input image to normalize its brightness, contrast, and convert it to grayscale. The steps involved are:

Brightness Normalization: Converts the image from BGR to LAB color space, applies histogram equalization on the L channel, and converts it back to BGR.
Contrast Normalization: Uses CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) on the L channel to enhance contrast.
Grayscale Conversion: Converts the image to grayscale after normalization.
2. Embedding Extraction
get_all_embeddings(img_path)
This function extracts face embeddings from an image using the DeepFace library. The steps are:

Image Reading: Reads the image from the specified path.
Processing: Normalizes brightness, contrast, and converts to grayscale.
Embedding Extraction: Uses DeepFace with the Facenet512 model to generate an embedding for the processed image.
Temporary File Handling: Saves the processed image as a temporary file, extracts the embedding, and deletes the temporary file.
3. CNN Model
CNNModel Class
Defines a simple 1D convolutional neural network for processing embeddings.

Architecture:
Layer: A single 1D convolutional layer (nn.Conv1d) that reduces the dimensionality of the embedding from 512 to 128.
get_CNN_embeddings(model, embed)
This function processes embeddings through the CNN model:

Tensor Conversion: Converts the embedding to a PyTorch tensor.
Batch Dimension: Adds a batch dimension if necessary.
Model Processing: Passes the tensor through the CNN model to obtain processed embeddings.
Output Handling: Converts the output tensor back to a NumPy array or list.
4. Matching Percentage Calculation
matching_percentage(img_path1, img_path2)
Compares embeddings of two images and calculates the percentage of matching elements:

Embedding Extraction: Extracts embeddings for both images.
CNN Processing: Processes the embeddings through the CNN model.
Matching Calculation: Calculates the number of matching elements and computes the percentage of matching elements between the two processed embeddings.
5. Directory Handling
Image Directory Setup: Lists all images in a specified directory and its subfolders to gather images for processing and embedding extraction.
Usage
Install Dependencies

Ensure you have the required libraries installed. Use the following command to install them:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python deepface torch numpy
Run the Script

Modify the dir variable to point to your directory containing images. The script processes images from this directory and calculates matching percentages between images.

Example Usage

To calculate the matching percentage between two images, use the matching_percentage function:

python
Copy code
percentage = matching_percentage('path/to/image1.jpg', 'path/to/image2.jpg')
print(f"Matching Percentage: {percentage:.2f}%")
Notes
Temporary File Handling: A temporary grayscale image file is created and deleted after processing to use with DeepFace.
Embedding Dimensions: The CNN model reduces the embedding dimension from 512 to 128. Adjustments to the model or parameters may be necessary based on specific requirements.
Directory Structure
The script assumes the following directory structure for images:

css
Copy code
/content/drive/MyDrive/AK/A/
    ├── class1/
    │   ├── image1.jpg
    │   ├── image2.jpg
    │   └── ...
    ├── class2/
    │   ├── image1.jpg
    │   ├── image2.jpg
    │   └── ...
    └── ...
